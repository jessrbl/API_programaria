Important Notes

I plan to enhance this API in future projects, using fastify instead of express, SQL database, as well as modifying the overall concept of the API, as I want to cover a broader niche, which would be women in science. Once development is complete, I'll leave the link below, even for comparison purposes to see the evolution of the API.

Thank you for your attention =)
